keep a global flag 'server_error' which can be true or false

Requests to /* will respond with a 200 response code and meta information
about the instance. If the server_error flag is set to true then instead the
instance will provide the same response but with a 503 server error code.

Requests to /health return the same as the above

Requests to /stop will set the server_error flag to true
Requests to /start will set the server error flag to false
