Simple Server is a simple, do nothing HTTP server which responds with a 200
HTTP response code and information about its environment (such as server
version, response headers, hosting IP address, operating system, etc). 

The server can be configured to simulate a failure where, when a URL is
invoked such as '/stop' the server will afterward respond with a 503 internal
server error response until the '/start' url is invoked.

Simple Server also responds to '/health' with a 200 response including
information about request processing time.
